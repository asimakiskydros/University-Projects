# Mathematical Modeling Project

project header\*:

Implement the Fourier Series algorithm and use it to approximate the following functions:
* $f_1(x) = x, x\in(-\pi, \pi]$
* $f_2(x) = x^2, 0 < x \leq \pi$

Plot the results.

*\*There is no original header, the professor assigned us the tasks verbally.*
