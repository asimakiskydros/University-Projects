# Semantic Web - Project #1 - RDFS

Project header:

Create an ontology of your choosing using the capabilities of the RDFS model. Work in pairs. Use TopBraid Composer.

Your ontology should at least contain:
* $\geq 30$ classes
* $\geq 15$ rdfs:subClassOf branches
* Valid semantic usage of hierarchical properties such as is-a and part-of
* $\geq 20$ object properties
* $\geq 20$ data properties
* $\geq 2$ rdfs:subPropertyOf branches between object properties and another 2 for data properties.
* Valid semantic hierarchy of properties
* Valid domain and ranges on properties that require them
* $\geq 50$ instances
* Values on all relevant properties of each instance
* $\geq 3$ non-trivial SPARQL queries on your ontology

Usage of OWL properties at this stage is strictly prohibited.
