# Semantic Web - Project #2 - OWL

Project header:

Enrich the ontology of project #1 with elements from the OWL model. Work on the same pairs. Work on Protege or TopBraid Composer.

Your ontology should at least contain:
* $\geq 10$ someValuesFrom restrictions
* $\geq 10$ allValuesFrom restrictions
* $\geq 5$ hasValue restrictions
* $\geq 10$ of the above restrictions must be declared as equivalentClasses to existing classes and
  be directly responsible for the inference of at least one individual per restriction, otherwise
  they won't count.
* $\geq 2$ unionOf
* $\geq 2$ intersectionOf
* $\geq 10$ disjointWith
* $\geq 5$ SymmetricProperty
* $\geq 5$ TransitiveProperty
* $\geq 4$ inverseOf
* $\geq 2$ FunctionalProperty
* $\geq 2$ InverseFunctionalProperty
* As many new individuals as needed to cover the new elements.
* Valid semantic hierarchy and no inconsistencies.
