# Object Oriented Programming Lab

The course offered 9 labs, each aiming to familiarize us with different essential elements of Java and OOP.
They all followed the same formula; you're given a code template with instructions, complete it.

Notes: 
* Each lab task was complimented by a header-pdf, which were projected to us live and thus I never got.
* Good rule of thumb, comments and method/function names were pre-existing, everything else is my work.
