# Object Oriented Programming Lab

The course offered 9 labs, each aiming to familiarize us with different essential elements of Java and OOP.
They all followed the same formula; you're given a code template with instructions, complete it.

Each lab task was complimented by a header-pdf, which were projected to us live and thus never got.
