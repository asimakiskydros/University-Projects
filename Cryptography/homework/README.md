# Homework

Weekly homework on the Cryptography course.

* **Homework 1:**
    - Given the cryptosystem shown, and the distribution Pr[M = 'α'] = 0.7, Pr[M = 'ω'] over M, calculate Pr[C = 'β'].
    - Suppose new distribution Pr[M = 'ενα'] = 0.3, Pr[M = 'δυο'] = 0.7 over M, calculate Pr[C = 'θπδ'].
* **Homework 2:**
    - Suppose a predictable coin. Give an experiment that uses this coin to achieve true randomness.
    - Name the prerequisites for the Caesar Cipher to be perfectly secure.
    - Given the cryptosystem shown, examine if it is semantically secure.
* **Homework 3:**
    - Suppose LFSR of length 4 with a feedback polynomial of $f(x) = x^4 + x^2 + x + 1$ and seed $(x[3], x[2], x[1], x[0])$. Find the outputs $y[0] - y[8]$ as functions of $x[i]$.
    - Suppose $y[5] = y[8] = 1, y[6] = y[7] = 0$. Find the initial seed without brute force.
* **Homework 4:**
    - Calculate the correlation coefficient of $f,g : \mathbb{F}^3_2 \rightarrow {0, 1}, f(x) = x_1x_2 \oplus x_3, g = x_1 \oplus x_3$.
    - Given the S-box S, calculate its differential uniformity.
    - Prove that Eve can't successfully attack a CBC-mode block cipher with the same strategy as the ECB-mode non-semantic security game.
