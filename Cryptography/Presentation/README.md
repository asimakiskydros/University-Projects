# Complexity Analysis on Integer Multiplication

A presentation I was tasked to do on the Cryptography course, covering the history of Integer multiplication algorithms,
analyzing their function complexity.

Algorithms covered here in order of appearance:
* Rudimentary addition
* Long multiplication
* Karatsuba's algorithm
* Toom-Cook family of algorithms and Toom-3
* Schonhage-Strassen algorithm
* Furer's algorithm
* Harvey-Hoeven algorithm
