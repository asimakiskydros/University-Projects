# Project 1: Symmetric Cryptography

project headers:

1. You are given a string of greek characters and the encryption method used. Decrypt the message.
2. You are given two strings of latin characters that were encrypted with the Vigenere cipher. Decrypt them using the Kasiski test or Friedman's method.
3. Suppose the following encryption method for 16-bit messages m: $c = m \oplus (m << 6) \oplus (m << 10)$. Give the general decryption formula and implement it in code.
4. Prove that a substitution cipher where the keys are chosen at random from $$ \{0, 1, ..., 23\} $$ has perfect security.
5. Implement OTP, that accepts and returns text, using the given table.
6. Calculate the amount of reduced polynomials of degree 10 in the body $\mathbb{F}_2$, using the given formula.
7. Implement RC4 and encrypt the given message with the given seed. Use the same table as task 5.
8. Given the S-box S, calculate its differential uniformity.
9. Examine whether AES-128 has the avalanche effect. Try both ECB and CBC modes. Use messages 2 blocks in length.
10. You are given the locked "secure.zip". Open it. (Hint: the Introductory PDF contains everything you need).
