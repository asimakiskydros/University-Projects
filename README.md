# University Projects

The majority of the projects I was called to implement during my university studies are archived here.

Notes:
* I've unfortunately lost some of the original headers.
* All uploaded answers are my final attempts for each task, as sent to each corresponding professor. While most solutions are correct, some may be way off.
* Github blows the percentage of "Jupiter Notebook Language" way out of proportion. My top language should be Python or Java.
* Some projects were joint efforts. I try, in such cases, to provide a fork to the original repository so all contributions are visible. Such cases will not be further included here.
