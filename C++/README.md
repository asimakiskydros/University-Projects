# Data Structures Lab - C++

The lab part of the Data Structures course was essentially dedicated to teaching C++ basics.
Each of the 7 initial labs had a summation task at the end, and a homework task for next time.
Lab 8 was a recap to prepare us for exams.

The professors would upload the assignments on a site dedicated to the course, which is why I don't have the headers.
Regardless of category, we were given the main.cpp file for each task. The goal was to implement the rest so it abode with what main expected.
The grading was done automatically through the same site.
