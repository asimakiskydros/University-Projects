# Process-Scheduling-Algorithms-Operating-Systems-Project

Project header:

Implement in C the following scheduling algorithms, as taught in theory: 
* FCFS
* SJF (non preemptive)
* SRTF
* Round Robin (any quantum)

You may assume that the processes are given in the order they arrive, that there are no idle periods between them and that all input files
follow the expected format.

Make sure that your algorithms return the same outputs as those shown in the two given test folders for the
two given test inputs, and that they execute correctly in a Linux environment.
