# Autonomous Intelligent Systems Project

project header:

Use the SimBad environment to create a simple robot that can traverse an unknown environment and reach a lamp.
Terms:
    * Your robot may have light sensors, SONARs, LASERs and/or bumpers.
    * Your robot may NOT know its global position, the lamp's global position, or any obstacle's global position ever. The use of getCoords() is strictly prohibited.
    * SimBad by default has two lamps. You must only have one enabled and set it wherever, 2 meters above the ground.
    * Your robot must reach a distance of at at most 0.6 meters with the lamp's projection on the ground.
    * Your robot should be able to be environment-independent. This means that you should build an obstacle-avoiding mechanism. I-Bug is the recommended approach.
