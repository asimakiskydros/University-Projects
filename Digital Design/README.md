# Digital Design Project

project header:

Design and implement the following in the Logisim environment:
1. An ALU that accepts two 2bit inputs and can perform the operations NOT_A, ADD, XOR, NAND, A+1.
   Let the output also be 2bit. Include selection bits so a user can choose which operation is 
   executed each time.
2. A mod-9 sychronous up-counter using negative-edge-triggered JK flip flops.
