# Numerical Analysis - Project #2

Project headers\*:

5. Approximate the **sin(x)** function using Lagrange's method, the splines method and the Least Squares method. Use your own sample points.
  Compare the outcomes of the three methods.
6. Approximate the value of $I = \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} sin(x)dx$ using the table method and Simpson's method.
7. Predict the closing stock of CENER and CNLCAP for the next 6 sessions since epoch (15/01/2021). Use the last 10 sessions as samples and apply Least Squares again.
  Try 2-degree, 3-degree and 4-degree polynomials. Decide which approach is best for predicting volatile values such as these.
