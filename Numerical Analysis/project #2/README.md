# Numerical Analysis - Project #2

Project headers\*:

5. Approximate the **sin(x)** function using Lagrange's method, the splines method and the Least Squares method. Use your own sample points.
  Compare the outcomes of the three methods.
6. Approximate the value of $I = \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} sin(x)dx$ using the table method and Simpson's method.
