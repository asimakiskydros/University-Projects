# Expert Systems

Full project header:

* part 1: You're given the descriptions of 10 chemicals, which, based on their qualities, are split in
          weak and strong acids, neutral and weak and strong bases. Build the correct class tree classifying
          all this knowledge. You're also given 8 warehouses (or stores) that contain said chemicals, as well
          as their stream to the control station through manholes. Build the correct graph of
          chemicals-stores-manholes-control station, as shown in the yellow parts\* of the header. Work in Protege.
          Work in triads.
* part 2: Work on the static knowledge implemented in part 1 (or use the indicative solution given after its evaluation)
          to implement a query system on CLIPS 6.3 or 6.4 that detects the source and chemical culprits of a contamination
          based on evaluated metrics made by experts working on the control station about the chemical qualities of the 
          contamination. The program should continuously ask for the bare minimum amount of context until it zeros down
          the contamination to a single store. The chemical culprits can be more than one.
  
*\*The header was the same for both projects. The yellow part concerned part 1, while the rest part 2.*
