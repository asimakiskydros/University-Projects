# Data-Structures-Project

Project header\* :

Implement in C++ the following data structures to the best of your abilities:
unsorted array, sorted array, simple binary search tree, avl binary search tree, hash table.
Use the data of the given input.txt file\*\* to time these structures against each other,
based on the time it takes them to insert the above document and search and delete a sample of 1000 words from the
same document (pick these words however you like). Print these stats to the screen.
Take note that some words in this file may be garbled, so you should normalize them to just
lowercase latin characters and numbers. Work in pairs\*\*\*.

(\* Note that this project is from my second semester, therefore the original header has been lost and
the provided code is basically ancient).

(\*\* This document was 30GB heavy so even if I still had it I doubt I could (or should) have uploaded it here).

(\*\*\* The two arrays were implemented by my group partner and the hash table through pair programming.)
